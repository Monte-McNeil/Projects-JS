# Projects-JS
Personal Projects made with Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS
This repo is responsible for holding all of my vanilla JS projects, with the use of HTML & CSS as well. Although they may not be original ideas, the code is mine. Each project (big or small) is aimed to help my problem solving techniques & challenge my knowledge of the tech used.
